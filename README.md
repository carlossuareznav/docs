## Manual Installation
In order to manually install MkDocs you'll need Python installed on your system, as well as the Python package manager, pip. You can check if you have these already installed from the command line:
```
$ python --version
Python 2.7.2
```

```
$ pip --version
pip 1.5.2
```

## Installing MkDocs
Install the mkdocs package using pip:

```
pip install mkdocs
```


## Run server
```

```

## Building the site
That's looking good. You're ready to deploy the first pass of your MkLorum documentation. First build the documentation:

```
mkdocs build
```
